1. Introduction
	a) The slow constant decay of the outer belt is generally attributed to hiss waves, however faster changes 
	are thought to be caused by geomagnetic activity
	b) HHS-driven storms are thought to cause large electron dropouts, which are often followed by a greater 
	flux than that of the pre-storm population
	c) It is thought that the electromagnetic ion cyclotron (EMIC) mechanism may have a large part in the
	scattering and precipitation of electrons into the atmosphere

	d) Mission Summary:
		i) Investigating MeV electron precipitation by using the SAMPEX Heavy Ion Large Telescope (HILT)
		to make direct measurements of precipitation loss
		ii) 2 Types of Precipitation:
			1) Microbursts: millisecond-long bursts (<1s)
			2) Precipitation Bands: longer-duration fluxes (~5-30s)
	e) MLT = Magnetic Local Time

2. SAMPEX/HILT Observations
	a) 2.0 Intro:
		i) SAMPEX was launched in 1992 and remained in operation until 2012
		ii) An array of 16 solid-state detectors were used to count electron flux
		iii) HILT had a view angle of 68 degrees by 68 degrees
		iv) 4 different modes of the instrument were used to collect anywhere from 20 to 100 ms rates of 
		>1 MeV electrons
		v) The equitorial loss cone in the outer radiation belt is less than ~6 degrees. At lower altitudes,
		this loss cone opens up to greater than ~60 degress (this is where SAMPEX is)
		vi) 3 Types of Particles:
			1) BLC = particles that will be lost to the atmosphere within one bounce period
			2) DLC = particles that will be lost to the atmoshpere within one drift period
			3) Trapped = Particles that will remain trapped in the magnetosphere for longer
		vii) A differential of count rates between the SSD1 and SSD4 is indicative of anisotropic (uneven)
		distribution of these 3 types, while little difference is indicative of isotropic distribution
		viii) Figure 1 shows how a typical anisotropic distribution can converge in uniform isotropy 
		when SAMPEX passes through parts of the outer belt (rapid flux increase)

	b) 2.1 Microbursts:
		i) These <1 ms precipitation bursts have been recorded by low-altitude detectors as early as 1964
		ii) It is estimated that the physical size of such microbursts is on the order of 10km (?)
		iii) Thought to be caused by whistler mode chorus waves and upper hybrid resonance waves

	c) 2.2 Precipitation Bands:
		i) More likely spatially varying rather than temporally (time) varying, these precipitation bands
		can last for hours
		ii) Some may be induced by electromagnetic ion cyclotron (EMIC) waves which peak during geomagnetic
		storms and persist into the recovery phase

	d) 2.3 Automated Identification:
		i) How does the algorithm work?
