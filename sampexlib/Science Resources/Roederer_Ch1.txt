Roederer Ch 1.1:

1) OFR - original frame of reference

2) 3 types of periodicity:
	a) Cyclotron motion: periodicity in the motion perp to the mag field
		- ex: an electron spiralling around a mag field line
	b) Bounce motion: periodic motion up and down the magnetic field line
		- ex: an electron travelling from the celestial equatorial region to a pole along a mag field line
		then back toward the equatorial region
	c) Drift motion: periodic motion on a closed surface/shell made up of mag field lines
		- ex: an electron hopping from field line to field line

3) trapping field - any mag field in which particles have the capability of bounce motion
	a) if drift motion can also occur, it is called stable trapping

4) GCS (guiding center system) - a moving frame of reference in which cyclotron motion appears as a nearly
circular periodic orbit

5) Drift velocity - the perpendicular velocity of the GCS frame
Parallel velocity - the average of the particle's instantaneous parallel velocity
