CHAPTER 3

Observations of radiation belt losses due to cyclotron wave-particle interactions

3.1 Introduction

	1) The Van Allen radiation belts are composed primarily of semi-trapped energetic electrons and ions
	surrounding the Earth.
	2) Typical belt structure includes an inner zone of stably trapped energetic electrons and ions and a
	dynamic outer zone of energetic electrons
	3) Inhancement and depletion methods include: a) energization or deenergization from radial transport,
	b) outer boundary loss, c) dramatic acceleration events, and d) steady or bursty precipitation loss to the
	atmosphere

	4) A better understanding of these interrelated processes is necessary if we want to mitagate the effects
	of space weather on our satellites and ozone depletion
	5) SUMMARY: This paper will provide a breif overview of the various types of electron precipitation
	observed, followed by a review of the three plasma waves most often responsible for causing radiation belt
	precipitation loss: 
		i) plasmaspheric hiss waves
		ii) chorus waves
		iii) electromagnetic ion cyclotron (EMIC) waves

3.2 Background

3.2.1 Doppler-shifted cyclotron resonance and quasi-linear theory

	1) Complicated theory on how left-hand (right-hand for ions) polarized EM waves can cause resonance with
	electrons
	2) EMIC waves are a type of left-hand polarized waves that interact with MeV energy electrons
	3) This resonance causes a diffusion of electrons in pitch angle and energy

3.2.2 Overview of precipitation observations (SKIPPED)

3.2.3 Key wave modes involved in radiation belt electron loss

3.2.3.1 Plasmaspheric Hiss

	1) a structureless, broadband EM whistler-mode emission (found within the plasmasphere)
	2) amplitude: 10-100 pT (peaks at ~300-400 Hz); frequency: ranges from ~100-800 Hz
	3) Hiss waves that do not grow locally have been observed to originate from a whistler-mode chorus wave
	that has propagated into the plasmasphere
	3) these hiss waves can react with electrons of energies of a couple keV to MeV levels
	4) EFFECT: thought to play a dominant role in creating a quiet-time (no storm) slot region, between the 
	inner and outer belts structure in the belts

3.2.3.2 Chorus

	1) Whistler-mode chorus is a VLF wave that exists in the low-density magnetosphere (outside of the 
	plasmasphere) that is often observed as distinctive rising and falling tones of several kHz/s
	2) separated into 2 bands:
		i) Lower band: 0.1-0.5 fraction of the fundamental electron cyclotron frequency
		ii) Upper band: 0.5-0.8 fraction of the fundamental electron cyclotron frequency
	3) Lower-band chorus is typically much stronger and more common than upper-band chorus and interacts
	with high energy electrons
	4) In general, chorus waves are thought to originate from temperature anisotropy instability near the
	magnetic equator
	5) EFFECT: result in electron scattering to lower pitch angles, precipitation in the form of aurora,
	localized storm-time enhancements of electrons to MeV energies, and MeV microbursts

3.2.3.3 Electromagnetic ion cyclotron

	1) electromagnetic fluxuations that occur primarily in the dayside and afternoon sectors in the heart of
	the outer radiation belt
	2) frequency: ranges from 0.1-5 Hz (a little below the H+, He+, O+ ion cyclotron frequencies)
	3) thought to be generated by KeV ion populations with unstable temperature anisotropy
	4) EFFECT: result in scattering of keV ions in the ring current and MeV electrons in the outer belt, which
	is often seen as simultaneous keV ion and MeV electron precipitation into the atmosphere
