Magnetosphere Indices: from https://www.ngdc.noaa.gov/stp/solar/magindices.html

Index Data found here: https://www.ngdc.noaa.gov/geomag/indices/indices.html

 - 3 Categories of Indices:
	a) Auroral zone: AE
	b) Mid-latitude: Kp
	c) Low-latitude/Equitorial: Dst 

 - The three indices (AE/Kp/Dst) are described in the monograph "Derivation, Meaning, and Use of Geomagnetic
	Indices" (Mayaud, 1980)

 - AE Index: the range between AU and AL indices ( AE = AU - AL )
	a) AU - amplitude of the upper envelope of the H-traces*
	b) AL - amplitude of the lower envelope of the H-traces*

	* What is the definition of the H-traces?

 - In general, the AE index is defined as a quantative measure of substorm intensity

 - Dst Index: measure of globally symmetric contribution of the ring-current
