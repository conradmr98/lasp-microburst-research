Presentation - Rapid enhanced precipitation of radiation belt electrons: microbursts and precipitation bands

1) Outer Radiation Belt Dynamics:
	a) MeV electron flux detected by the SAMPEX satellite correlates to spikes in the solar wind speeds (these
	spikes seem to occur 3 or 4 years after a solar maximum)
	b) Most of these flux events occur within the 3-7 L-Shell range
	
2) Outer Radiation Belt Dynamics:
	a) From observations of different storms, varying responses in electron dynamics:
		i) Increase in electron flux -> enhancements
		ii) Decrease in electron flux -> depletions
		iii) No change in electron flux -> no change in magnetosphere
	b) Balance of SOURCE processes (solar wind?) and LOSS processes (electron precipitation) produce net
	radiation belt response to storms

3) Radiation Belt Losses:
	a) PSD - phase space density
	b) MP - Magnetopause (boundary between the solar wind and the Earth's magnetosphere)
	c) At the beginning of a storm, the magnetopause is pushed closer to Earth, with a high local PSD. As the
	storm progresses, the PSD wave travels to lower L-Shells and the magnetopause returns to original position.
	As storm ends, PSD wave continues to even lower L-Shells and decreases in PSD magnitude substancially. This
	is likely caused by precipitation.

4) Precipitation:

5) Waves:

6) Wave-Particle Interactions:

7) Whistler Mode Chorus Waves:
	a) Generated by anisotropic keV electrons on the MLT morning side
	b) Develop outside of the plasmapause
	c) Can cause electron loss and acceleration

8) Whistler Mode Chorus Waves:

9) EMIC:
	a) Generated by keV ring current ions (postive particles) injected during storms
	b) Low frequency waves (0.1-5 Hz)
	c) Able to resonate with and pitch-angle scatter MeV electrons

10) EMIC:

11) Microbursts and Precipitation Bands:
	a) Microbursts: <1 s bursts of electron precipitation
	b) Precipitation Bands: ~sec-min MeV electron enhancements

12) Microbursts and Precipitation Bands:

13) What are microbursts?
	a) Some keV electron precipitation microbursts were first detected by balloons in 1960s and 1970s
	b) MeV electron microbursts were discovered by S81-1 spacecraft in 1992
	c) Loose correspondence betweent hese two types of microbursts

14) Where are microbursts?
	a) MeV microbursts peak at midnight during quiet times, but peak in the morning during active times

15) Potential Causes of Microbursts:
	a) keV microbursts are associated with pitch-angle scattering by VLF (very low frequency) chorus
	b) MeV microbursts are associated with pitch-angle scattering by higher frequency, higher latitude chorus
