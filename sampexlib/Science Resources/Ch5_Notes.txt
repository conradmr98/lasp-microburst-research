Ch 5 Radiation Belts

5.0 Introduction:

 - The Earth's radiation belts create small cavity in the interplanetary medium where particles from the solar wind
	are contained to trajectories limited to the magnetic field lines of Earth's magnetosphere

 - Magnetic force from the magnetic field lines causes electrons to spiral in circles. As the electorn travels to
	the north or south pole, the magnetic field lines converge. This creates a lorentz force pushing back the
	way the electron came from

 - Mirror point: the point along a magnetic field line at which the electron is reflected back the way it came

 - Particle drift motion is primarily caused by a differential on magnetic field strength (where a lower altitude
	has a higher field strength and a higher field altitude has a lower field strength). This causes orbital
	radius of curvature to be less on the inside of the spiral motion causing an eastward drift for negatively
	charged particles and a westward drift for positively charged particles

 - Electrons in the radiation belts travel at ~0.85c while heavier particles travel at <0.03c

 - Loss cone: the range of pitch angles of particles with mirror points inside the Earth's atmosphere (lost)

 - Pitch angle: the angle between the velocity vector of the particle and the magnetic field line

5.1 Theoretical Preliminaries:

 - Although a general solution to the mathematical problem of the motion of energetic charged particles in 
	a dipolar magnetic field has never been found, in 1963 simplification was found called the adiabatic
	theory for trapped particles.

5.1.1 Single Particle Motion

 - Three motion types: gyro (cyclotron), bounce, and drift

 - Motion frequencies as follows:  f_gyro  >>  f_bounce  >>  f_drift

5.1.2 Adiabatic Invariants

 - adiabatic invariants: certain quantities that remain relatively unchanged during particle motion

 - Hamilton-Jacobi action variable: an adiabatic invariant integral associated with the three periodic modes of
	motion

 - First Adiabatic Invariant: Evaluating the HJ action variable over the particle gyro motion
 - Second Adiabatic Invariant: Evaluating the HJ action variable over the particle bounce trajectory
 - Third Adiabatic Invariant: Evaluating the HJ action variable over the particle drift motion around the earth

5.1.3 Particle Drift Motion

 - As a particle approaches a geomagnetic pole, the magnetic field lines converge. This stronger magnetic field
	will act forces on the particle tightening its gyro motion and pushing it back the way it came. The 
	tighter orbit motion would also cause a drift velocity perpendicular to the B field direction.

 - Extraterrestiral Ring Current: due to negatively charged particles (electrons) drifting east and positively
	charged particles (ions) drifting west, there is a net westward electrical current encircling the earth.

5.2 Trapped Radiation Sources

5.2.1 Qualitative Description

 - Likely Sources:
	1) Solar wind particles and energetic solar particle emissions
	2) Particles from the earth's ionosphere
	3) Cosmic ray albedo neutron decay
	4) Particles from the magnetospheres of other planets
	5) Low energy components of cosmic rays
	6) Acceleration of low energy trapped particles already in the radiation belts

 - Injections of solar energetic particles may occur during magnetic storms

 - It is thought that the ionosphere is responsible for lower energy particles in the magnetosphere, while
	extraterrestrial sources are responsible for high energy particles in the magnetosphere

5.2.2 Simplifying Assumptions

 - We still do not know:
	1) The source strength for different particle species as a function of energy and pitch angle
	2) The effective source locations on the boundaries of the trapping location
	3) The source strength as a function of different geophysical conditions during quiet and disturbed times
