	3.2 Differentiating Between Drifting and Precipitating Curtains

		- Curtains are hypothesized to be the drifting remnants of microbursts (Blake and O'Brien, 2016).
		To determine whether electrons are precipitating (microbursts) or drifting (curtains),  one can
		check to see the event's spatial relation to the SAA.

		- Bounce loss cone (BLC): electron population with equatorial pitch angles small enough for
		precipitation to occur within one bounce period

		- Drift loss cone (DLC): electron population with equatorial pitch angles large enough to avoid
		precipitation within one bounce period but small enough to precipitation to occur within one
		drift period (when arriving the South Atlantic Anomoly).
