Possible Research Theses:

	1) Event Study: 9 storm epoch study (<100nT)

		a) Statistical analysis of relation between microburst occurance and magnetic indices (AE & Dst) during 9 storms in 1993. In this study, we can
		quantitatively state how correlated each magnetic index is with microburst occurance throughout these storms.
			i) Review outlier points
			ii) Determine occurence trends for each region of storm
				- Look for quantitative comparison between each region
				- 
			iii) Goodness of fit calc -> Compare results between AE/Pre-Dst/Main-Dst/Rec-Dst

		b) A qualitative of analysis can also be conducted documenting the behavior of Microburst Pitch Angle Isotropy compared to Background Pitch Angle
		Isotropy. This will help determine the actual effects that geomagnetic disturbances have on the loss processes of electrons in the radiation belts.
			i) Plot MB/BG iso progression for each individual storm
			ii) Create epoc study?
			iii) Mathematically analyze the ratio (maybe?) between MB and BG isotropies as AE and Dst change
				- Might involve other mathematical methods
 				- Could use *difference* calc rather than ratio (try both)

	2) Statistic Analysis: Full year study (1993)

		a) Isotropy vs Mag/MLT/Pitch/LShell:
			i) Show plots of all 4 comparisons
			ii) Mathematical comparison between MB and BG 2d histograms to normalize data
				- still working on the best approach to this
			iii) Dial plot to show how Average MB/BG Isotropy is correlated to L-Shell and MLT
				- Could make a plot of the ratio between these

		b) Magnitude vs Iso/MLT/Pitch/LShell:
			i) Not sure if we want to go far in this direction (less usable results)
